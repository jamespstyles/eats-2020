# Eats

Very basic theme to demonstrate HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Please note

I've used jQuery and vanilla JS, just to demonstrate both - usually it'd be one or the other. I'd probably combine `menuToggle.js` and `serachToggle.js` into one `toggles.js` file and use some data attributes.

The styles are close to the design but I'm aware they are not pixel perfect, for that I'd either need a full design file. Also we're not hitting AAA accessibility due to colors.
